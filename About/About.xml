Lord of the Rims - Dwarves is a mod package that is part of the Lord of the Rims series for RimWorld. 
The mod adds in a number of dwarf-related content such as:
  * Dwarves as a playable race
  * Dwarven furniture, walls, and doors
  * Dwarven weapons, armor, and toys
  * Plants: Earthbread, Honeyroot, and Mead
  * Giant Boars (GiddyUp supported)
  * Factions: Kingdom Under the Mountain, Dwarven Hill Clans, and Dwarven Bandits
  * Starting scenario: Dwarves - Homeless
  * ... and a special event for dwarves.
