    <content>The Dwarven-throne and other throneroom furniture can now be used to fulfill Royalty-titles.
The information on what items are needed might not show the dwarven items due to a limitation in the game, but once the required structure is built it should recognize it.
Thanks SoongJr for most of the work on this update!
